Hello! This is the first project from my Front-end User interfaces course that I took in the Spring of 2024 (no worries, we have permission to post these in public repos!) 

This is a simple html page representing a virtual market. It features several linked pages, images, as well as interactions such as adding items to your cart, calculating sales tax depending on your state, checking out, and applying for a job.
